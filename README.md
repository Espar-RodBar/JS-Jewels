A game like Candy Crush made with Vanilla Javascript.

This project was built after seeing the walkthrough made by Ania Kubov.

Some parts are made with a little different aproach.

In this project we use:
- the drag and drop events
- addEventListener
- setInterval
- setTimeOut
- every
- forEach
- filter
- map
- insertAdjacentElement
- unshift
- Maths.abs
- Math.random
- Math.floor
- rest arguments in functions

And some DOM manipulation.
